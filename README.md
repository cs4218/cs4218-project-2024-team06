## Virtual Vault
Virtual Vault is a full stack e-commerce website, built using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). Features include user authentication, payment gateway integration, search and filters for products, and product set. ðŸ›’

The focus of this repository is to provide **comprehensive testing** for Virtual Vault in order to identify issues and bugs.

- [x] Unit Testing (Jest)
- [x] Continous Integration with build and unit testing (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Integration Testing (Jest)
- [x] UI Testing (PlayWright)
- [x] Code Coverage (SonarQube)
- [x] Performance Testing (JMeter)


### How to Run the Application
To run Virtual Vault, follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository to your local directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/cs4218/cs4218-project-2024-team06.git
```

2. Open the repository in a code editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code.

3. In the root directory, install the server-side dependencies.
```
npm install
```

4. Change directory to the client directory and install the client-side dependencies.
```
cd client
npm install
```
5. Return to the root directory and create a .env file. The .env file should have the following fields.
```
PORT = 6060
DEV_MODE = development
MONGO_URL = <Insert your MongoDB database URL>
JWT_SECRET = <Insert your JWT secret key>
BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID = <Insert your BrainTree merchant ID>
BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY = <Insert your BrainTree public key>
BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY = <Insert your Braintree private key>
```

6. Run the following command to start the application
```
npm run dev
```

### How to Run Unit and Integration Tests
To run an individual unit or integration test, run the following command in the root directory.
```
npm test -- <Name of Unit Test File>
#e.g. npm test -- AdminDashboard.test.js
#e.g. npm test -- RegisterIntegration.test.js
```

To run all tests (unit + integration) at once, run the following command in the root directory.
```
npm test
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that your local server is not running in another terminal before running the integration tests. This is because some integration tests would spin up a server for testing, so they would not work if your local server is running in another terminal.

### How to Run UI Tests

#### Running a Single UI Test
The following illustrates the steps required to run a UI test, demonstrating it through an example.

1. Suppose we want to run a UI test called `adminCreateCategory.spec.mjs`.
2. Head to `.env`. Replace `MONGO_URL` with the URL of a test database.

> [!WARNING]  
> Please make sure that you update the `.env` file with the URL of a test database,
as the UI tests would wipe out the memory of the database during execution.

3. In a terminal, run `npm run dev` to start the local server.

4. In another terminal, run one of the following commands to execute the UI test.

```
#To generate test results in HTML format
npx playwright test adminCreateCategory.spec.mjs

#To view test results in UI mode
npx playwright test adminCreateCategory.spec.mjs -- ui
```

#### Running All UI Tests
To run all UI tests in the `tests` folder at once, use the following command. However, we would **discourage** doing this because the quick succession of some UI tests could lead to indeterministic test results at times.
```
#Runs all UI tests
npx playwright test tests/
```

### How to Run Performance Tests
Ensure that you have [JMeter](https://dlcdn.apache.org//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.6.3.zip) downloaded on your computer. The detailed instructions on how to run the performance tests can be found in the respective READMEs in the `performance-tests` folder.


### Location of Test Files
- Unit and integration tests are located in the same folder as the components that they are testing for.
- UI tests are located in the `tests` folder found in the root directory.
- Performance tests are located in the `performance-tests` folder found in the root directory.
